# ðŸ“ˆ Stock Price Classifier

This project aims to classify stock price movement (up/down) based on historical data and technical indicators using machine learning techniques in Python.

---

## ðŸš€ Goals
- Predict whether a stockâ€™s price will rise or fall based on historical trends
- Explore different ML models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, etc.
- Learn basic feature engineering techniques in financial datasets
- Build relevant experience for finance-focused ML internships

---

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack
- Python
- yfinance
- pandas, NumPy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib / seaborn
